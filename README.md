## Spotify Integration ðŸŽµ

The app now supports **full Spotify music playback** for hosts with Spotify Premium! This provides a much better experience than preview clips.

### How It Works

- **Host-Only Playback**: Only the game host hears the music (via Spotify Web Playback SDK)
- **Full Track Access**: Plays 30-second segments from anywhere in the song
- **Premium Required**: Host needs Spotify Premium for full track playback
- **Smart Fallback**: Falls back to preview clips or mock data if needed

### 1. Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App Name**: Music Guesser
   - **App Description**: Multiplayer music guessing game
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:5173/auth/spotify/callback`
5. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Spotify credentials:

   ```bash
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
   ```

### 3. Run the App & Authenticate

```bash
npm run dev
```

**For Hosts (Optional Enhanced Experience):**

1. Click "Connect Spotify" on the welcome screen
2. Log in with your Spotify Premium account
3. Create a game as host
4. Enjoy full track playback during rounds!

**For Players:**

**That's it!** The game will now:

- âœ… Play full Spotify tracks for hosts with Premium (required)
- âœ… Use 30-second segments from random parts of songs
- âœ… Provide high-quality audio experience with full songs
- âœ… Dynamic music categories from Spotify's Browse API

- âœ… Work perfectly for all players regardless of Spotify status

### Features with Spotify Web Playback SDK

- **Full Track Access**: Hosts play complete songs, not just 30-second previews

- **Host-Only Audio**: Only the game host hears music - others rely on host's guidance
- **Premium Experience**: Requires Spotify Premium for host, free for all players
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically falls back to preview clips or mock data
- **Easy Authentication**: One-click Spotify login via OAuth
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within the existing game flow

- **Scoring**: 100 base points + speed bonus (up to 60 extra points)
- **Question Types**: 50/50 split between artist and song name questions
- **Minimum Players**: 1 player (host can play alone for testing)
