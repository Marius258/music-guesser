# Spotify Integration Improvements Summary

## Problem Solved

The original Spotify integration was returning tracks without preview URLs, making the music guessing game unplayable with real audio.

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Search Strategy**

- **Era-Based Queries**: Focus on tracks from 2000-2020 (older tracks more likely to have previews)
- **Genre-Specific Searches**: Target popular genres with better preview availability
- **Popular Artist Targeting**: Search for well-known artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Drake, etc.
- **Specific Track Queries**: Search for known hits that definitely have previews

### 2. **Multiple Data Sources**

- **Search API**: Primary method using improved queries
- **Featured Playlists**: Secondary method using Spotify's curated playlists
- **Market Targeting**: Added "US" market parameter for better preview availability

### 3. **Track Caching System**

- **In-Memory Cache**: Stores tracks with confirmed preview URLs
- **Cache Duration**: 30-minute cache to avoid repeated API calls
- **Preloading**: Cache is populated when the service initializes
- **Fallback Strategy**: If cache fails, falls back to direct API calls

### 4. **Better Filtering & Selection**

- **Preview URL Validation**: Only select tracks with non-null preview URLs
- **Popularity Threshold**: Prefer tracks with popularity score > 20/30
- **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts with different strategies
- **Improved Logging**: Better debugging information

### 5. **Robust Error Handling**

- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to mock data if all Spotify methods fail
- **Rate Limiting**: Adds delays between API requests
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

## Code Changes

### `src/lib/server/spotify.ts`

1. **Updated Query Arrays**: More targeted search terms
2. **Added `getTopTracks()` Method**: Uses featured playlists
3. **Added Track Caching**: `populateTrackCache()` and `getTracksFromCache()`
4. **Enhanced `getRandomTrackForRound()`**: Multi-strategy approach
5. **Added Market Parameter**: Better regional preview availability
6. **Improved Error Messages**: More descriptive logging

### Testing

Created `test-spotify.mjs` to verify:

- Spotify credentials configuration
- API access and token retrieval
- Track search effectiveness
- Preview URL availability rates
- Featured playlists functionality

## Expected Results

- **Higher Success Rate**: Much more likely to find tracks with preview URLs
- **Better Performance**: Caching reduces API calls and improves response time
- **More Reliable Gameplay**: Reduced chances of silent rounds or fallback to mock data
- **Better Track Quality**: Focuses on popular, well-known songs
- **Comprehensive Fallback**: Multiple strategies ensure the game keeps working

## Usage

The improvements are automatic - no changes needed to the game UI or WebSocket server. The service will:

1. Try to get tracks from cache first (fastest)
2. If cache is empty/expired, use multiple search strategies
3. Fall back to mock data only if all Spotify methods fail
4. Provide detailed logging for debugging

Players should now experience consistent, high-quality music playback with real Spotify tracks!
